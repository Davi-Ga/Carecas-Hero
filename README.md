# CarecasHero
My project for IFG's My first Game initiative.

Carecas's Hero is a pixelated platform game where your objective is to defeat enemies endlessly.

The game was designed entirely in AppGameKit(AGK), AGK is based on the Basic language and can also use C++

The sprites of the game were downloaded from OpenGameArt, the author is GrafxKid
